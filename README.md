You can run the application via bin/dev. Currently, I am not able to add Redis to bin/dev
and test it because I program on Windows and I already have a lot of problems to solve.

On this project I didn't focus too much on the front end because my main
goal was to present my skills on the backend side.
I would have spent too much time refining every detail

Unfortunately, I currently have no idea how to solve the issue of showing
appropriate dates and times for booking an appointment.
But I implemented validations on the backend side
